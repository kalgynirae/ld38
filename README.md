# Something’s Fishy

One of America’s Founding Fathers has been turned into a fish! This is
unfortunate, but there’s nothing you can do about it right now. Instead, help
him investigate why blobs of color that should be purple are actually yellow and
red!!

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.5+ (I think, but I only tested on Python 3.6)
